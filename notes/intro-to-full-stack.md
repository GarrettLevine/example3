## What is our "full stack"?

Full Stack developers typically build **web applications**:
- Website + API + Database = Web Application

in this class, this will look like:
- React + Express + MongoDB = Your Final Project

This will be our stack. And since it allows us to deliver an end to end solution, we can call it a **full stack**.

---

## Languages

We will use the followining languages in the class:

Front-end languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

Back-end languages:
- JavaScript (ES6)
---

## Technologies

Front-end technologies:
- React (User Interface)
  - `react-router`
- Axios (Communicating with our Backend)

Back-end technologies:
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Tokens (for authentication)

Other technologies we will cover/discuss:
- Heroku (for deploying our apps)
- `create-react-app` (for building our React app)
- Compass (GUI for exploring Mongo databases)
- Webpack (for managing our build process)

---

## Class Goals
By the end of this class, you should feel confident building and deploying a **small-scale** full stack application.

---

## What this class does not teach
We may cover these topics tangentially, but we will not have full day lessons on:
- Intro to React (we will cover this, but only briefly on day 1)
- Building a web application at scale
- Redux
- Relational (SQL-based) databases

---

## How do get the most out of this class
- Come to every class
- Come to Wednesday office hours
- Work on your project/the material covered in class outside of class time
- Be vocal about the things you don't understand (take ownership over your learning)
- Make a commitment to learning and to your own growth
- Don't be late
- If you are going to be late, please message the lead mentor to let us know
- If I'm going too fast, please ask me to slow down
- If you need help, flag down a mentor.

## Class Setup

### Code Editor
You can use any of the following code editors for this class:
- Atom
- Sublime
- Visual Studio Code
- Brackets
- WebStorm

If you'd like to use a different editor, please run it by the instructor.

### Git

You should have git installed on your computer and have an account registered with GitHub. If you don't, let's take a minute now to get that set up!

## Folder Organization
- Wherever you keep your sites, create a new folder called `{year}-{cohort}-fullstack`. Where `{cohort}` is `spring`, `summer`, `fall`, or `winter`.
- In `{year}-{cohort}-fullstack`, create three folders: `material`, `class-work`, and `project`.
- Inside `class-work`, create 9 folders, `day{num}`, where `{num}` is the week number, like: `day1`, `day2`, etc.
- By the end, you should have something that looks like this:

```shell
{year}-{cohort}-fullstack/
├── material/
│   └── {clone-github-repo}
├── class-work/
│   ├── day1/
│   ├── day2/
│   ├── day3/
│   ├── day4/
│   ├── day5/
│   ├── day6/
│   ├── day7/
│   ├── day8/
│   └── day9/
└── project/
    └── project-proposal.md
```
