Full Stack developers typically build **web applications**:
- Website + API + Database = Web Application

in this class, this will look like:
- React + Express + MongoDB = Your Final Project

This will be our stack. And since it allows us to deliver an end to end solution, we can call it a **full stack**.

## Class Goals
By the end of this class, you should feel confident building and deploying a **small-scale** full stack application.
