## The Room of Requirement, a private room that you can use
Sometimes you many need a private space while you're here at HackerYou; to breastfeed or pump, contemplate in prayer or any for other reason. If you would like a private room for these or any reason, we have outfitted one of the meeting rooms in HackerTwo with a lockable door and blind for privacy.

If you would like to use this room and are in one of the HackerYou HQ classrooms, please ask your lead mentor or instructor for an access fob to HackerTwo and to help direct you to the room. If you are in the HackerTwo side you can use the fob to Lounge level.
