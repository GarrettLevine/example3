## Attendance Policy and Missed Classes

Occasionally, you may have to miss a class for work, personal reasons, or you may be running late. We completely understand that life happens and that you sometimes may miss part or all of a lesson.

If you know in advance that you will miss a class, make sure you tell your **lead mentor** as soon as possible--a quick message in Slack or email is fine! Please coordinate with them to catch up on the lesson you will miss.

We will be taking attendance at every class and if we don't see you and haven't already heard from you, we will check in and make sure all is well.

If you do have to miss a class, we expect that you will make time to read over the notes for the lesson you have missed. Please plan to arrive 30 minutes early to your next lesson to check in with a mentor and make sure you're comfortable with the material.

We can not offer a streaming or recorded version of any missed lessons.

## Statutory Holidays

HackerYou does not hold lessons on stat holidays or stat holiday weekends. Your instructor and mentor team will notify you in advance when your class will be cancelled for a stat holiday.
